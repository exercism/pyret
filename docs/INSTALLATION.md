# Installation

Please review the [official installation directions][install-docs]. The [official online editor][cpo] that can be used by most modern browsers and is generally the recommended way to use Pyret out of the box. However, an experimental command-line interface (CLI) is also available through the [pyret-npm][pyret-npm] package by first installing [NodeJS][node-js] follwing your platform's directions and then the [pyret-npm][pyret-npm] package. Currently, the offline CLI works best in Linux and MacOS, but Windows users will need to install it using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)][wsl] or a virtual machine of their choosing.

# Installation

You can install Pyret by first installing [NodeJS][node-js] for your operating system. After that, you can use the `npm` package manager to install the [pyret-npm][pyret-npm] package by running `npm install pyret-npm`.


## IDEs

Because offline use of Pyret is experimental at the moment, there isn't strong IDE support and using the [online CPO editor][cpo] will generally give you the best experience out of the box. Syntax highlighting is provided in Atom and Pulsar Edit by [atom-language-pyret][atom-language-pyret] or in Visual Studio Code by [the Pyret extension][vscode-pyret].

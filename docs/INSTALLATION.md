# Installation

Please review the [official installation directions].
The [official online editor] can be used by most modern browsers and is generally the recommended way to use Pyret out of the box.
However, a command-line interface (CLI) is also available by first installing [NodeJS] following your platform's directions and then the [pyret-npm] package.
Currently, the offline CLI works best in Linux and MacOS, but Windows users will need to install it using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)] or a virtual machine of their choosing.

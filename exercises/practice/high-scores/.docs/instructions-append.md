Many of our lower-level Pyret exercises are solveable with only [function application expressions] in the form of `foo(1)` . This exercise however expects that [dot expressions] can be used to access data and method fields on what your function returns. This can be done with [object expressions], allowing you to access the fields of an object literal. [Data declarations] are a similar but more advanced approach that utilizes data and method fields as well.
